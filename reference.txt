## üå≥ Decision Trees - Core Concepts

### What is a Decision Tree?
A **Decision Tree** is a flowchart-like structure where:
- **Internal nodes** represent tests on attributes (e.g., "Age ‚â§ 31?")
- **Branches** represent outcomes of tests (Yes/No)
- **Leaf nodes** represent final decisions (Approve/Reject)

### How Decision Trees Learn

#### **1. Information Gain & Entropy**
The algorithm uses mathematical concepts to find the best questions to ask:

```python
# Entropy measures "impurity" in data
# High entropy = mixed results (some approved, some rejected)
# Low entropy = consistent results (mostly approved OR mostly rejected)

# Information Gain = How much does asking this question reduce uncertainty?
```

**Example:**
- Before asking any questions: 50% approved, 50% rejected (high entropy)
- After asking "Age ‚â§ 31?": 
  - Young group: 80% approved, 20% rejected (lower entropy)
  - Old group: 20% approved, 80% rejected (lower entropy)

#### **2. Splitting Criteria**
The algorithm tries different questions and picks the one that best separates approved from rejected loans:

```python
# For Age: Try splits at 25, 30, 35, 40... which works best?
# For Loan Term: Try splits at 5, 7, 10, 12... which works best?
# Pick the question that creates the "purest" groups
```

#### **3. Tree Construction Process**
```python
def build_tree(data):
    if all_same_class(data):  # All approved or all rejected
        return create_leaf_node(data)
    
    best_question = find_best_split(data)  # Using information gain
    left_data, right_data = split_data(data, best_question)
    
    left_subtree = build_tree(left_data)   # Recursively build left branch
    right_subtree = build_tree(right_data) # Recursively build right branch
    
    return create_internal_node(best_question, left_subtree, right_subtree)
```

### Why Decision Trees Work Well for Loans
1. **Interpretability**: Easy to explain to loan officers and regulators
2. **Handle Mixed Data**: Works with both numbers (age, income) and categories (gender, loan type)
3. **Non-linear Relationships**: Can capture complex patterns
4. **Feature Importance**: Shows which factors matter most

## üìú Rule Extraction Process

### How Rules are Formed

#### **1. Tree Traversal**
The system walks through every path from root to leaf:

```python
def extract_path_to_leaf(node, current_path):
    if is_leaf(node):
        # We've reached a decision - create a rule
        rule = create_rule(current_path, node.decision)
        return rule
    
    # Not a leaf - continue down the tree
    left_path = current_path + [node.question + " = YES"]
    right_path = current_path + [node.question + " = NO"]
    
    extract_path_to_leaf(node.left_child, left_path)
    extract_path_to_leaf(node.right_child, right_path)
```

#### **2. Rule Format**
Each path becomes an IF-THEN rule:

```
Path in tree: Age ‚â§ 31 ‚Üí Loan Term ‚â§ 8.5 ‚Üí APPROVE
Becomes rule: IF (Age ‚â§ 31) AND (Loan Term ‚â§ 8.5) THEN APPROVE loan
```

#### **3. Code Implementation**
```python
def _extract_rules_recursive(self, node_id, path):
    feature = self.model.tree_.feature[node_id]
    threshold = self.model.tree_.threshold[node_id]
    
    if feature != -2:  # Not a leaf node
        feature_name = self.feature_names[feature]
        
        # Left child (condition <= threshold)
        left_path = path + f" AND {feature_name} <= {threshold:.2f}"
        # ... continue recursively
        
        # Right child (condition > threshold)  
        right_path = path + f" AND {feature_name} > {threshold:.2f}"
        # ... continue recursively
```

### Types of Rules Generated

#### **1. Simple Rules (Direct paths)**
```
IF age <= 31.0 THEN Loan Sanctioned = 1
```

#### **2. Complex Rules (Multiple conditions)**
```
IF age <= 31.0 AND Loan Term in Years <= 8.5 THEN Loan Sanctioned = 1
IF age <= 31.0 AND Loan Term in Years > 8.5 THEN Loan Sanctioned = 0
```

#### **3. Confidence Measures**
```python
confidence = max(samples_in_leaf) / total_samples_in_leaf
# Example: 15 approved, 2 rejected ‚Üí Confidence = 15/17 = 88.2%
```

## ü§ñ Prolog Knowledge Base

### What is Prolog?
**Prolog** (Programming in Logic) is a programming language based on formal logic. It's perfect for representing rules and making logical inferences.

### Why Use Prolog for Knowledge Representation?

#### **1. Natural Rule Representation**
```prolog
% Natural way to express logic
loan_approved(Age, LoanTerm) :- 
    Age =< 31,
    LoanTerm =< 8.5.
```

#### **2. Automatic Reasoning**
```prolog
% Query: Is a 25-year-old with 6-year term approved?
?- loan_approved(25, 6).
% Prolog automatically checks: 25 =< 31 ‚úì, 6 =< 8.5 ‚úì
% Answer: Yes
```

#### **3. Backwards Chaining**
```prolog
% Question: What conditions lead to approval?
?- loan_approved(Age, LoanTerm).
% Prolog finds: Age =< 31, LoanTerm =< 8.5
```

### Prolog Syntax Explanation

#### **Basic Structure**
```prolog
% Fact (something that's always true)
human(socrates).

% Rule (if-then relationship)
mortal(X) :- human(X).

% Query (asking questions)
?- mortal(socrates).
```

#### **Our Loan Knowledge Base**
```prolog
% Rule 1: Young applicants with short loans get approved
loan_approved(Sex, Age, LoanTerm, NumAccounts, LoanType, LoanArea) :-
    Age =< 31,           % Age must be 31 or less
    LoanTerm =< 8.5.     % AND loan term must be 8.5 years or less

% Rule 2: Young applicants with long loans get rejected
loan_rejected(Sex, Age, LoanTerm, NumAccounts, LoanType, LoanArea) :-
    Age =< 31,           % Age is 31 or less
    LoanTerm > 8.5.      % BUT loan term is more than 8.5 years

% Rule 3: Older applicants generally get rejected
loan_rejected(Sex, Age, LoanTerm, NumAccounts, LoanType, LoanArea) :-
    Age > 31.            % Age is more than 31 (other factors don't matter)

% Classification predicate
classify_loan(Sex, Age, LoanTerm, NumAccounts, LoanType, LoanArea, approved) :-
    loan_approved(Sex, Age, LoanTerm, NumAccounts, LoanType, LoanArea).

classify_loan(Sex, Age, LoanTerm, NumAccounts, LoanType, LoanArea, rejected) :-
    loan_rejected(Sex, Age, LoanTerm, NumAccounts, LoanType, LoanArea).
```

### How to Use the Prolog Knowledge Base

#### **1. Installation**
```bash
# Install SWI-Prolog (most popular Prolog implementation)
# On Mac: brew install swi-prolog
# On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
# On Windows: Download from https://www.swi-prolog.org/
```

#### **2. Loading the Knowledge Base**
```prolog
% Start SWI-Prolog and load the file
?- consult('loan_knowledge_base.pl').
```

#### **3. Making Queries**
```prolog
% Test specific case
?- classify_loan(male, 25, 7, 2, personal, 100, Result).
% Result = approved

% Find all conditions for approval
?- loan_approved(Sex, Age, LoanTerm, NumAccounts, LoanType, LoanArea).
% Age = A, A =< 31, LoanTerm = B, B =< 8.5

% Check why someone was rejected
?- loan_rejected(male, 35, 10, 3, home, 200).
% true (because Age > 31)
```

## üîç Implementation Details

### Your Current Implementation

#### **1. Class Structure**
```python
class LoanDecisionTree:
    def __init__(self, data_path):
        self.data_path = data_path          # Path to CSV file
        self.df = None                      # Will hold the dataset
        self.model = None                   # Will hold trained model
        self.feature_names = None           # Column names for features
        self.label_encoders = {}            # For categorical encoding
        self.rules = []                     # Extracted rules
```

#### **2. Data Loading Process**
```python
def load_data(self):
    self.df = pd.read_csv(self.data_path)
    print("Dataset shape:", self.df.shape)        # Shows rows x columns
    print("Target distribution:")                  # Shows approved vs rejected counts
    print(self.df['Loan Sanctioned'].value_counts())
```

#### **3. Feature Engineering**
```python
def preprocess_data(self):
    # Define feature columns
    self.feature_names = ['sex', 'age', 'Loan Term in Years', 
                         'Number_of_Accounts', 'Loan Type', 'Loan Area']
    
    # Separate features (X) and target (y)
    X = self.df[self.feature_names].copy()
    y = self.df['Loan Sanctioned']
    
    # Create human-readable mappings
    self.sex_mapping = {1: 'Male', 2: 'Female'}
    self.loan_type_mapping = {1: 'Personal', 2: 'Home', 3: 'Auto'}
```

### Model Training Process

#### **1. Train-Test Split**
```python
# Split data: 80% for training, 20% for testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Why this split?
# - Training set: Teaches the algorithm
# - Test set: Evaluates performance on unseen data
# - random_state=42: Ensures reproducible results
```

#### **2. Model Configuration**
```python
self.model = DecisionTreeClassifier(
    random_state=42,        # Reproducible results
    max_depth=10,          # Prevents overfitting (too complex trees)
    min_samples_split=5,   # Need at least 5 samples to make a split
    min_samples_leaf=2,    # Each leaf must have at least 2 samples
    criterion='gini'       # Method for measuring impurity
)
```

**Parameter Explanations:**
- **max_depth**: Limits tree depth to prevent memorizing training data
- **min_samples_split**: Prevents splitting on very small groups
- **min_samples_leaf**: Ensures decisions are based on enough evidence
- **criterion='gini'**: Mathematical measure of impurity (alternative: 'entropy')

#### **3. Training Process**
```python
# The actual learning happens here
self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# What happens inside fit():
# 1. Algorithm examines each feature and possible split points
# 2. Calculates information gain for each possible split
# 3. Chooses the split that best separates approved/rejected loans
# 4. Repeats recursively until stopping criteria are met
```

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundations

### Information Theory Concepts

#### **1. Entropy**
Entropy measures uncertainty in a dataset:

```
H(S) = -Œ£(p_i * log2(p_i))

Where:
- S = dataset
- p_i = proportion of class i
- Lower entropy = more pure/predictable
```

**Example:**
```python
# Dataset with 50% approved, 50% rejected
entropy = -(0.5 * log2(0.5) + 0.5 * log2(0.5)) = 1.0  # Maximum uncertainty

# Dataset with 90% approved, 10% rejected  
entropy = -(0.9 * log2(0.9) + 0.1 * log2(0.1)) = 0.47  # Lower uncertainty
```

#### **2. Information Gain**
Information gain measures how much a split reduces uncertainty:

```
Information_Gain = Entropy(parent) - Weighted_Average_Entropy(children)
```

**Example:**
```python
# Before split: 50% approved, 50% rejected (entropy = 1.0)
# After splitting on Age <= 31:
#   Left branch (young): 80% approved, 20% rejected (entropy = 0.72)
#   Right branch (old): 20% approved, 80% rejected (entropy = 0.72)

# If 60% of people are young, 40% are old:
weighted_entropy = 0.6 * 0.72 + 0.4 * 0.72 = 0.72
information_gain = 1.0 - 0.72 = 0.28
```

#### **3. Gini Impurity** (Alternative to Entropy)
```
Gini(S) = 1 - Œ£(p_i^2)

Where:
- p_i = proportion of class i
- Ranges from 0 (pure) to 0.5 (maximum impurity for binary classification)
```

### Statistical Measures

#### **1. Confidence in Rules**
```python
confidence = correct_predictions_in_leaf / total_predictions_in_leaf

# Example: Leaf node has 15 approved, 3 rejected
confidence = 15 / (15 + 3) = 0.833 = 83.3%
```

#### **2. Support of Rules**
```python
support = total_samples_matching_rule / total_samples_in_dataset

# Example: Rule applies to 25 out of 100 total samples
support = 25 / 100 = 0.25 = 25%
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **1. Low Model Accuracy**
**Problem**: Model accuracy below 80%
```python
# Diagnostic steps:
print("Feature importance:", model.feature_importances_)
print("Tree depth:", model.get_depth())
print("Number of leaves:", model.get_n_leaves())

# Solutions:
# 1. Increase max_depth
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=15)  # Instead of 10

# 2. Reduce min_samples_split
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_split=2)  # Instead of 5

# 3. Check for data quality issues
print("Missing values:", df.isnull().sum())
print("Data types:", df.dtypes)
```

#### **2. Overfitting (Perfect Training, Poor Test Performance)**
**Problem**: 100% training accuracy, 60% test accuracy
```python
# Solutions:
# 1. Reduce max_depth
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)

# 2. Increase min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_split=10, min_samples_leaf=5)

# 3. Use cross-validation
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
print("Cross-validation scores:", scores)
```

#### **3. Unbalanced Classes**
**Problem**: 90% approved loans, 10% rejected
```python
# Check class distribution
print("Class distribution:")
print(df['Loan Sanctioned'].value_counts(normalize=True))

# Solutions:
# 1. Use balanced class weights
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight='balanced')

# 2. Use stratified sampling
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42
)
```

#### **4. File Path Issues (Your Implementation)**
```python
# Make sure paths are correct in your code
data_path = '/Users/saraswathi/Projects/Projects/example_building_knowlege_base_AI/data/Loan - Loan dataset.csv'

# Use relative paths for better portability
data_path = 'data/Loan - Loan dataset.csv'

# Check if file exists
import os
if os.path.exists(data_path):
    print("Data file found!")
else:
    print("Data file not found!")
```

### Performance Optimization

#### **1. Speed Improvements**
```python
# Use sparse matrices for large datasets
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
X_sparse = csr_matrix(X)

# Optimize tree parameters for speed
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(
    max_depth=8,           # Shallower trees = faster predictions
    min_samples_split=20,  # Fewer splits = simpler tree
)

# Use model persistence
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'loan_model.pkl')  # Save trained model
model = joblib.load('loan_model.pkl')  # Load quickly later
```

#### **2. Memory Optimization**
```python
# Use appropriate data types
df['age'] = df['age'].astype('int8')           # Instead of int64
df['loan_term'] = df['loan_term'].astype('int8')
df['sex'] = df['sex'].astype('category')       # For categorical data
```

### How Your Code Works

#### **1. Main Execution Flow**
```python
def main():
    # Initialize with your data path
    dt = LoanDecisionTree('path/to/your/data.csv')
    
    # Load and explore data
    dt.load_data()
    
    # Train the model
    dt.train_model()
    
    # Extract rules
    tree_rules = dt.extract_rules()
    simplified_rules = dt.get_simplified_rules()
    
    # Visualize
    dt.visualize_tree()
    
    # Save results
    # Rules saved to 'decision_rules.txt'
    
    return dt  # Return trained model for use
```

#### **2. Making Predictions with Your Model**
```python
# After running main()
model = main()

# Test a loan application
result = model.predict_loan(
    sex=1,           # 1=Male, 2=Female
    age=28,          # Age in years
    loan_term=6,     # Loan term in years
    num_accounts=2,  # Number of accounts
    loan_type=1,     # 1=Personal, 2=Home, 3=Auto
    loan_area=200    # Loan area code
)

print(f"Decision: {result['prediction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2%}")
```

### Generated Files Explanation

#### **1. decision_rules.txt**
Contains both raw tree rules and simplified human-readable rules from your model.

#### **2. decision_tree_visualization.png**
Visual representation of your trained decision tree showing:
- Decision nodes with splitting conditions
- Leaf nodes with final decisions
- Sample counts at each node
- Color coding for different outcomes

#### **3. Feature Importance Output**
Your model shows which features matter most:
```python
# Example output from your model:
# age: 0.7090 (70.9% importance)
# Loan Term in Years: 0.2500 (25.0% importance)  
# Other features: Lower importance
```

This tells you that **age** is by far the most important factor in loan decisions, followed by **loan term length**.

## üöÄ Next Steps and Enhancements

### Potential Improvements to Your Code

#### **1. Add Prolog Knowledge Base Generation**
```python
def generate_prolog_kb(self):
    """Generate Prolog knowledge base from extracted rules"""
    prolog_rules = []
    
    # Convert your extracted rules to Prolog format
    for rule in self.rules:
        # Parse rule and convert to Prolog syntax
        prolog_rule = self.convert_to_prolog(rule)
        prolog_rules.append(prolog_rule)
    
    # Save to .pl file
    with open('loan_knowledge_base.pl', 'w') as f:
        f.write("% Loan Decision Knowledge Base\n")
        f.write("% Generated from Decision Tree\n\n")
        for rule in prolog_rules:
            f.write(rule + "\n")
```

#### **2. Add Interactive User Interface**
```python
def interactive_loan_classifier(self):
    """Interactive interface for loan classification"""
    print("=== Loan Classification System ===")
    
    sex = int(input("Sex (1=Male, 2=Female): "))
    age = int(input("Age: "))
    loan_term = float(input("Loan term (years): "))
    num_accounts = int(input("Number of accounts: "))
    loan_type = int(input("Loan type (1=Personal, 2=Home, 3=Auto): "))
    loan_area = int(input("Loan area code: "))
    
    result = self.predict_loan(sex, age, loan_term, num_accounts, loan_type, loan_area)
    
    print(f"\n=== RESULT ===")
    print(f"Decision: {result['prediction']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2%}")
    
    return result
```

#### **3. Add Model Validation**
```python
def validate_model(self):
    """Comprehensive model validation"""
    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
    
    X, y = self.preprocess_data()
    
    # Cross-validation
    cv_scores = cross_val_score(self.model, X, y, cv=5)
    print(f"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}")
    print(f"Average CV score: {cv_scores.mean():.4f} (+/- {cv_scores.std() * 2:.4f})")
    
    # Feature importance analysis
    feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
        'feature': self.feature_names,
        'importance': self.model.feature_importances_
    }).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
    
    print("\nFeature Importance Ranking:")
    print(feature_importance)
    
    return feature_importance
```
